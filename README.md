# Django Local Library

With the help of the Django framework with the python language, I managed to make a web page, which was basically a library, in which books of any kind such as magazines, stories, etc. are stored. All the information was stored in a database.

## Overview

This web application creates an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

The main features that have currently been implemented are:

* There are models for books, book copies, genre, language and authors.
* Users can view list and detail information for books and authors.
* Admin users can create and manage models. The admin has been optimised (the basic registration is present in admin.py, but commented out).
* Librarians can renew reserved books
